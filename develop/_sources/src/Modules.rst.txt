.. _Modules:

====================================
The ChampSim Module System
====================================

ChampSim uses four kinds of modules:

* Branch Direction Predictors
* Branch Target Predictors
* Memory Prefetchers
* Cache Replacement Policies

Modules are implemented as C++ objects.
The module should inherit from one of the following classes:

* ``champsim::modules::branch_predictor``
* ``champsim::modules::btb``
* ``champsim::modules::prefetcher``
* ``champsim::modules::replacement``

The module must be constructible with a ``O3_CPU*`` (for branch predictors and BTBs) or a ``CACHE*`` (for prefetchers and replacement policies).
Such a constructor must call the superclass constructor of the same kind, for example::

    class my_pref : champsim::modules::prefetcher
    {
        public:
        explicit my_pref(CACHE* cache) : champsim::modules::prefetcher(cache) {}
    };

One way to do this, if your module's constructor has an empty body, is to inherit the constructors of the superclass, as with::

    class my_pref : champsim::modules::prefetcher
    {
        public:
        using champsim::modules::prefetcher::prefetcher;
    };

A module may implement any of the listed member functions.
If a member function has overloads listed, any of them may be implemented, and the simulator will select the first candidate overload in the list.

----------------------------
Branch Predictors
----------------------------

A branch predictor module may implement three functions.

.. cpp:function:: void initialize_branch_predictor()

   This function is called when the core is initialized. You can use it to initialize elements of dynamic structures, such as ``std::vector`` or ``std::map``.

.. cpp:function:: bool predict_branch(uint64_t ip, uint64_t predicted_target, bool always_taken, uint8_t branch_type)
.. cpp:function:: bool predict_branch(uint64_t ip)

   This function is called when a prediction is needed.

   :param ip: The instruction pointer of the branch
   :param predicted_target: The predicted target of the branch.
       This is passed directly from the branch target predictor module and may be incorrect.
   :param always_taken: A boolean value.
       This parameter will be nonzero if the branch target predictor determines that the branch is always taken.
   :param branch_type: One of the following

     * ``BRANCH_DIRECT_JUMP``: Direct non-call, unconditional branches, whose target is encoded in the instruction
     * ``BRANCH_INDIRECT``: Indirect non-call, unconditional branches, whose target is stored in a register
     * ``BRANCH_CONDITIONAL``: A direct conditional branch
     * ``BRANCH_DIRECT_CALL``: A call to a procedure whose target is encoded in the instruction
     * ``BRANCH_INDIRECT_CALL``: A call to a procedure whose target is stored in a register
     * ``BRANCH_RETURN``: A return to a calling procedure
     * ``BRANCH_OTHER``: If the branch type cannot be determined

   :return: This function must return true if the branch is predicted taken, and false otherwise.

.. cpp:function:: void last_branch_result(uint64_t ip, uint64_t branch_target, uint8_t taken, uint8_t branch_type)

   This function is called when a branch is resolved. The parameters are the same as in the previous hook, except that the last three are guaranteed to be correct.

-----------------------------------
Branch Target Buffers
-----------------------------------

A BTB module may implement three functions.

.. cpp:function:: void initialize_btb()

   This function is called when the core is initialized. You can use it to initialize elements of dynamic structures, such as ``std::vector`` or ``std::map``.

.. cpp:function:: std::pair<uint64_t, bool> btb_prediction(uint64_t ip, uint8_t branch_type)
.. cpp:function:: std::pair<uint64_t, bool> btb_prediction(uint64_t ip)

   This function is called when a prediction is needed.

   :param ip: The instruction pointer of the branch
   :param branch_type: One of the following

     * ``BRANCH_DIRECT_JUMP``: Direct non-call, unconditional branches, whose target is encoded in the instruction
     * ``BRANCH_INDIRECT``: Indirect non-call, unconditional branches, whose target is stored in a register
     * ``BRANCH_CONDITIONAL``: A direct conditional branch
     * ``BRANCH_DIRECT_CALL``: A call to a procedure whose target is encoded in the instruction
     * ``BRANCH_INDIRECT_CALL``: A call to a procedure whose target is stored in a register
     * ``BRANCH_RETURN``: A return to a calling procedure
     * ``BRANCH_OTHER``: If the branch type cannot be determined

   :return: The function should return a pair containing the predicted address and a boolean that describes if the branch is known to be always taken.
       If the prediction fails, the function should return a default-initialized address, e.g. ``uint64_t{}``.

.. cpp:function:: void update_btb(uint64_t ip, uint64_t branch_target, uint8_t taken, uint8_t branch_type)

   This function is called when a branch is resolved.

   :param ip: The instruction pointer of the branch
   :param branch_target: The correct target of the branch.
   :param taken: A boolean value. This parameter will be nonzero if the branch was taken.
   :param branch_type: One of the following

     * ``BRANCH_DIRECT_JUMP``: Direct non-call, unconditional branches, whose target is encoded in the instruction
     * ``BRANCH_INDIRECT``: Indirect non-call, unconditional branches, whose target is stored in a register
     * ``BRANCH_CONDITIONAL``: A direct conditional branch
     * ``BRANCH_DIRECT_CALL``: A call to a procedure whose target is encoded in the instruction
     * ``BRANCH_INDIRECT_CALL``: A call to a procedure whose target is stored in a register
     * ``BRANCH_RETURN``: A return to a calling procedure
     * ``BRANCH_OTHER``: If the branch type cannot be determined

-----------------------------------
Memory Prefetchers
-----------------------------------

A prefetcher module may implement five or six functions.

.. cpp:function:: void prefetcher_initialize()

   This function is called when the cache is initialized. You can use it to initialize elements of dynamic structures, such as ``std::vector`` or ``std::map``.

.. cpp:function:: uint32_t prefetcher_cache_operate(uint64_t addr, uint64_t ip, bool cache_hit, bool useful_prefetch, access_type type, uint32_t metadata_in)
.. cpp:function:: uint32_t prefetcher_cache_operate(uint64_t addr, uint64_t ip, bool cache_hit, bool useful_prefetch, uint8_t type, uint32_t metadata_in)
.. cpp:function:: uint32_t prefetcher_cache_operate(uint64_t addr, uint64_t ip, bool cache_hit, uint8_t type, uint32_t metadata_in)

   This function is called when a tag is checked in the cache.

   :param addr: the address of the packet.
       If this is the first-level cache, the offset bits are included.
       Otherwise, the offset bits are zero.
       If the cache was configured with ``"virtual_prefetch": true``, this address will be a virtual address.
       Otherwise, this is a physical address.
   :param ip: the address of the instruction that initiated the demand.
       If the packet is a prefetch from another level, this value will be 0.

.. cpp:function:: uint32_t prefetcher_cache_fill(uint64_t addr, uint32_t set, uint32_way, uint8_t prefetch, uint32_t metadata_in)

   This function is called when a miss is filled in the cache.

   :param addr: the address of the packet.
       If this is the first-level cache, the offset bits are included.
       Otherwise, the offset bits are zero.
       If the cache was configured with ``"virtual_prefetch": true``, this address will be a virtual address.
       Otherwise, this is a physical address.
   :param set: the set that the fill occurred in
   :param way: the way that the fill occurred in, or ``this->NUM_WAY`` if a bypass occurred
   :param prefetch: if this tag check hit a prior prefetch, this value is true.
   :param metadata_in: the metadata carried along by the packet.

   :return: The function should return metadata that will be stored alongside the block.
