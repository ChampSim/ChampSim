To use this branch predictor you will need to install some dependencies. 

### Pre-Req install APT depts
Install wsl dependencies: 
```bash
sudo apt-get install gfortran bison autoconf automake autoconf-archive meson ninja-build libx11-dev libxft-dev libxext-dev libtool pkg-config liblz4-dev liblzma-dev libzstd-dev libarchive-dev libxtst-dev libxrandr-dev clang
```

```bash
sudo snap install protobuf flatbuffers 
```

and
```bash
python -m pip install jinja2
```


### Update the manifest
Update the `vcpkg.json` config file. 

```json
"dependencies" : {
    ...,
    "libtorch" // Add this
 }
```

### Just in-case
Re-run `bootstrap.sh`

### Finally
Install the c++ dependencies:

```bash
sudo vcpkg/vcpkg install --binarycaching
```

## __NOTE:__
This will take a LONG time to build. This is because PyTorch has a lot of dependencies to function.

Incase of a build failure, most of the time you are just missing a dependency for `apt` which will be made aware to you by reviewing the last bit of stack trace. 

If this is the case, install the dependency and add it to __Step 1__ of this file.
